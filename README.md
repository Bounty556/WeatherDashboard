# Weather Dashboard

## Description

A simple app for viewing the weather in a given city. Cities can be searched by their city name, city and state name, or city ID.

Weather information includes the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. Below the current city's weather information is a 5 day forecast including temperature and humidity. All weather information also includes a symbol summarizing the type of weather for that day. When you first open the webpage, there will be no weather information, but if you open the webpage again and have searched a city, you will be automatically shown the weather for the last-searched city.

Finally, there is also a search history list, which keeps track of the last 10 cities searched for. Items in the search history can be clicked to view their weather information again.
